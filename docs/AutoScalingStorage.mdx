# Auto-scaling storage

## Background

At present, the canister storage has been increased to 8G, but the memory storage is still 4G.

There is no storage API similar to the file system currently, which means that only 4G storage can be used.

## Problem to be solved

When we want to support saving more token transaction history, 4G storage will become a limitation.

## What's auto-scaling storage

Auto-scaling storage will solve the problems mentioned above.

## How does auto-scaling storage work?

## What is the storage structure?

## Has auto-scaling storage been implemented?

Yes, it has been implemented in DFT Standard

## Fallback strategy

The transaction history will be stored in the token when a token created by the DFT standard has not enough cycles to create auto-scaling storage.

When the token has enough cycles to create it, the transaction history store in the token will move to the auto-scaling storage.

## Use Case

### Production
Auto-scaling storage allows tokens created by the DFT standard to have unlimited transaction history storage

### Test
When issuing a token for testing, auto-scaling storage will not be created until more than 2000 txs. 2000txs can meet the needs of most test scenarios, it is unnecessary to consume cycles to create additional storage
